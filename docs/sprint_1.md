# ✅ Sprint Review: "Watch Your 6 (Backend)"

## Overview  
We successfully separated our **Fracturefell API runtime** into its **own infrastructure and repo**, moving from static prototypes to a **deployable serverless edge API**.

---

## Goals  
- Establish a **standalone backend API runtime**
- Deploy a **Cloudflare Worker** to the **global edge**
- Connect **GitHub source control** to **Cloudflare deployments**
- ✅ **Stretch Goal Identified**: Frontend consumption of the new API _(not tackled yet)_

---

## What We Achieved  

### ✅ **Backend Repo Created**
- New folder `fracturefell-api` scaffolded with Wrangler CLI  
- TypeScript template selected for future type safety

### ✅ **Local Dev Environment Running**
- API available on `localhost:8787` via `wrangler dev`

### ✅ **First Cloudflare Deployment**
- Live on **Cloudflare's global edge**
- Auto-generated **.workers.dev** URL confirmed functional

### ✅ **GitHub Repo Connected**
- Repo `fracturefell-api` created on GitHub
- CI/CD verified with **green build** from **GitHub to Cloudflare**

---

## Notes  
- ⚠️ **Future Consideration**: Roles, permissions, and author hierarchies (left out of scope for now)
- ⭐ **Developer Experience**: Cloudflare tooling exceeded expectations, far simpler than AWS or Azure
- ✅ **Foundational Infrastructure Complete**

---

## Next Sprint Candidates
- Connect the **frontend** to consume the live API  
- Add **environment-specific deployments** (staging, production)
- Define **first real packet schema and resolution logic**

---

### _Fracturefell API is live on the edge. Onward._
