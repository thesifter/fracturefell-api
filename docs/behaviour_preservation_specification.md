# 🎮 Thematic Behavior Preservation Specification

## Overview
Fracturefell is more than data delivery—it is **lore-powered experience delivery**. The following thematic anchors must be **preserved and expressed** in both **frontend behaviors** and **backend awareness**.

---

## 🧩 Content-Aware Behavior Preservation Checklist

### 🐜 Zergling Sightings
- **Narrative Flavor**: Paranoia, hunting, shadows moving.
- **Behavioral Expectation**: 
  - UI jitters or visual "scurrying" effects.
  - Possible spawn triggers that feel sudden or invasive.

### 🧮 MacGuffin Math (Laws of Non-Euclidean Time)
- **Narrative Flavor**: Cold, analytical, broken logic.
- **Behavioral Expectation**:
  - Monospace or console-style output.
  - Glitchy or looping logic presentation.

### 🌌 Void Awakening
- **Narrative Flavor**: Cosmic disturbance, whispering void.
- **Behavioral Expectation**:
  - Fading audio effects or signal breach simulations.
  - Slow reveal of text as if leaking through static.

### 📦 Sealed Box / Sealed Entity
- **Narrative Flavor**: Claustrophobic, pressurized, dangerous curiosity.
- **Behavioral Expectation**:
  - Locked content that reveals only on specific "unlock" triggers.
  - Tension-building effects like slow reveals or audio pulses.

## ⚠️ Why This Matters
- Prevents **loss of narrative identity** during technical refactors.
- Guides **behavioral fidelity** across frontend and backend implementations.
- Protects **player immersion** by linking content type to **unique UX treatments**.

---

## ✅ Backend Requirements
1. **Type-Aware Packet Resolution**
   - Backend must identify **narrative class** (e.g., Zergling, Void, Math) not just data type.

2. **Trigger Metadata Support**
   - Packets must carry **trigger references** that inform frontend behaviors.

3. **Behavioral Hint Metadata**
   - Optional backend hints to guide **frontend rendering styles** (e.g., "glitch", "console", "ambient").

---

## ✅ Frontend Requirements
1. **Behavior-Driven Rendering**
   - Frontend must **map packet types and triggers** to **UX effects**.

2. **Lore-Aware Presentation Logic**
   - Visuals, audio, and interaction patterns must **feel true to the narrative class**.

---

## 📝 Next Steps
- Expand **packet schema** to include **narrative behavior metadata**.
- Map **frontend rendering logic** to these behaviors.
